# Weather React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
This is a weather application that gets city data from an API. When a city is enter and the search button is clicked, data is fetched from an API.
The data is rendered to the DOM using state components. State and props are used between the parent and children components to access the data. 

# Technologies used for the Application

This project was developed with ReactJS which utilizes HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript.
